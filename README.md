# Provita Pharmeceuticals Website
This website was built for the student-run Pharmaceutical/Biotechnology company, Provita Pharmaceuticals. The company develops products to save lives.
### How the Website was Built
This website uses html, css, and javascript for the front-end, and javascript for the backend. Various different libraries were used, such as node.js, bootstrap, etc. Many packages were also installed with node.js for the back-end.
### The backend was not included in order to preserve the api keys as a secret for the company itself to behold
### The custom domain name will be added by 12/1/19
